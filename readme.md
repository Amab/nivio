# Nivio

Nivio is a tool for small scape application landscape management. It's heavily inspired by [pivio.io](http://pivio.io) and
 uses similar semantics, but has a different focus.

* **Easy to install and to maintain.** Runs dockerized on a single server with moderate to low
hardware requirements.
* **No-op usage besides initial configuration.** Designed to gather the application landscape information
from configurable sources, preferably code repos.
