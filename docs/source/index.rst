Welcome to Nivio's documentation!
=================================

Nivio is a tool for application landscape management targeted at teams (developers, operators, managers). It follows a no-op
approach, i.e. there is no interface for manual data maintenance. Instead, nivio pulls all its information from data
sources like files or web apis (e.g. monitoring services) or allows pushing information via its API.
